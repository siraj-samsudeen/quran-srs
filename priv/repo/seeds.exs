# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your
# repositories directly:
#
#     QuranSrs.Repo.insert!(%QuranSrs.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.

# Development seed data (sample users, demo progress, etc.)
# 
# Master data (Mushafs, Surahs, Pages, Items) is now managed through 
# database migrations for production safety and version control.
# See: priv/repo/migrations/*_seed_master_data.exs
#
# This file is reserved for development convenience data like:
# - Sample user accounts
# - Demo hafiz profiles  
# - Test memorization progress
# - Sample revision history

IO.puts("No development seed data yet - add sample users/progress here as needed")
