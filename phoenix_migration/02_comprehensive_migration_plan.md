# Comprehensive Phoenix Migration Plan

## Migration Philosophy

**"Migrate with confidence, enhance with intelligence."**

This plan implements the revolutionary 3-layer architecture (algorithms, patterns, assignments) while preserving 100% of your production data. Since you're the only production user willing to experience some inconvenience, we're going full aggressive mode to build the perfect system from day one.

---

## Executive Summary

### What We're Building
- **3-Layer Architecture**: Separates memorization algorithms from user patterns from runtime assignments
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Smart day planning, better SRS, graduation workflows  
- **Complete Data Migration**: Zero data loss from your SQLite production database
- **Phoenix Best Practices**: LiveView, contexts, PhoenixTest, PostgreSQL
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Your actual usage patterns become intelligent system defaults

### Migration Strategy: Full Aggressive Mode
1. **Complete redesign** with new architecture from day one
2. **Intelligent data transformation** that improves upon current structure
3. **Enhanced workflows** including all the UX improvements you wanted
4. **Comprehensive testing** with PhoenixTest matching your Playwright tests
5. **Progressive enhancement** starting with core features, expanding to advanced

## Phase 1: Foundation Architecture (Days 1-5)

### Project Setup and Core Infrastructure

#### Phoenix Project Creation
```bash
# Create project with all modern Phoenix features
mix phx.new quran_srs --database postgres --live
cd quran_srs

# Add enhanced dependencies  
# Add to mix.exs dependencies:
{:phoenix_test, "~> 0.3.0", only: :test}
{:faker, "~> 0.17", only: [:dev, :test]}
{:ex_machina, "~> 2.7", only: :test}
{:jason, "~> 1.0"}
{:tzdata, "~> 1.1"}

mix deps.get
```

#### Database Schema Implementation
Create the complete PostgreSQL schema using the 3-layer architecture:

**Core Tables (Direct Migration)**:
- users, hafizs, hafizs_users → Enhanced with new fields
- mushafs, surahs, pages → Direct migration with PostgreSQL types
- items → Enhanced with better metadata and personalization

**Algorithm Layer Tables (New)**:
- algorithms → 3 core memorization algorithms
- algorithm_parameters → What each algorithm can be configured with

**Pattern Layer Tables (Transformed)**:
- revision_patterns → Unified patterns replacing modes/booster_packs
- pattern_sharing → Community pattern templates
- Current `modes` + `booster_packs` + `srs_booster_pack` → `revision_patterns`

**Assignment Layer Tables (Enhanced)**:
- hafiz_item_assignments → Enhanced hafizs_items with pattern context
- day_plans → New enhanced day planning system
- day_plan_modifications → Track plan changes
- revisions → Enhanced with pattern context and analytics

**Advanced Features (New)**:
- similar_passage_groups → Handle confusing verses
- similar_passage_items → Group membership

### Data Migration Scripts

#### Intelligent Migration Strategy
Create migration scripts that don't just copy data, but enhance it:

```elixir
# Migration Script Strategy:
# 1. Analyze current usage patterns in production SQLite
# 2. Create intelligent default patterns based on actual behavior  
# 3. Transform old structure to new architecture
# 4. Preserve all relationships and history
# 5. Add enhancements that improve user experience

defmodule QuranSrs.DataMigration do
  # Analyze production data to create personalized defaults
  def analyze_current_patterns(sqlite_db_path) do
    # Analyze your current hafizs_items performance
    # Create personalized patterns based on your actual behavior
    # Extract similar passage confusion patterns
    # Build intelligent default configurations
  end
  
  # Transform modes to algorithms + patterns
  def migrate_modes_to_patterns() do
    # "0. Full cycle" → Sequential Maintenance algorithm + pattern
    # "1. Daily Reps" → Targeted Strengthening + daily pattern  
    # "2. Weekly Reps" → Targeted Strengthening + weekly pattern
    # "4. SRS - Variable Reps" → Targeted Strengthening + SRS pattern
    # "5. New Memorization" → New Memorization algorithm + pattern
  end
  
  # Enhance hafizs_items to assignments
  def migrate_hafizs_items_to_assignments() do
    # Preserve all statistics and performance data
    # Add pattern context to each assignment
    # Create graduation progress tracking
    # Add performance_stats JSONB with rich analytics
  end
end
```

## Phase 2: Core Contexts and Business Logic (Days 6-10)

### Phoenix Contexts Implementation

#### Quran Context
```bash
# Generate base contexts (modified from generators)
mix phx.gen.context Quran Mushaf mushafs name:string description:text total_pages:integer lines_per_page:integer --no-migration
mix phx.gen.context Quran Surah surahs number:integer name:string total_ayat:integer --no-migration

defmodule QuranSrs.Memorization do
  # Manages the 3-layer architecture:
  # 1. Algorithms (what the system can do)
  # 2. Patterns (how users want to use algorithms)  
  # 3. Assignments (current runtime state)
  
  def get_algorithm_by_name(name) # "sequential_maintenance", etc.
  def create_pattern_from_template(template_id, customizations)

  def skip_planned_items(plan_id, item_ids, reason)
end
```

#### Pattern Management System
```elixir
# lib/quran_srs/patterns.ex

## Testing Strategy with PhoenixTest

### Test Structure Matching Current Playwright Tests
```elixir
# test/quran_srs_web/live/auth_test.exs
defmodule QuranSrsWeb.AuthTest do
  use PhoenixTest
  
  test "successful login redirects to hafiz selection" do
    # Mirror your current Playwright test structure
    # But use PhoenixTest's more powerful LiveView testing
  end
end

# test/quran_srs_web/live/day_planning_test.exs  
defmodule QuranSrsWeb.DayPlanningTest do
  test "can pull items from future days" do
    # Test enhanced day planning features
  end
  
  test "graduation workflow functions correctly" do  
    # Test day closing and graduation logic
  end
end
```

### Data Migration Verification Tests
```elixir
# test/quran_srs/data_migration_test.exs
defmodule QuranSrs.DataMigrationTest do
  test "all production data migrates without loss" do
    # Verify every record migrates correctly
    # Verify all relationships are preserved  
    # Verify enhanced data is added appropriately
  end
end
```

---

## Data Migration Implementation

### SQLite to PostgreSQL Migration Script
```elixir
# lib/mix/tasks/migrate_production_data.ex
defmodule Mix.Tasks.MigrateProductionData do
  def run([sqlite_path]) do
    # 1. Connect to both databases
    # 2. Migrate static data first (mushafs, surahs, pages, modes→algorithms)
    # 3. Transform and migrate user data (users, hafizs, hafizs_users)
    # 4. Analyze and transform patterns (modes+booster_packs→revision_patterns)
    # 5. Migrate tracking data (hafizs_items→assignments, revisions with enhancements)
    # 6. Create intelligent defaults based on your usage patterns
    # 7. Set up similar passage groups for common confusion patterns
    # 8. Verify data integrity and relationships
  end
end
```

### Migration Data Intelligence
Based on your production database, the migration will:
- **Analyze your hafizs_items performance** to create personalized default patterns
- **Identify your weak page patterns** to pre-populate SRS configurations
- **Extract similar passage confusion** from your revision history
- **Create family-specific patterns** based on your usage
- **Set up intelligent defaults** that match your current behavior exactly

---

## Enhanced Features Implementation

### Smart Day Planning
- **Future Pulling**: Pull items from next 2-3 days when you have extra time
- **Intelligent Skipping**: Skip scheduled items with automatic rescheduling
- **Load Balancing**: System spreads catch-up work to avoid overload
- **Context Awareness**: Plans adapt to travel, busy periods, illness

### Advanced Graduation Workflow  
- **Graduation Candidates**: System identifies items ready to move between patterns
- **Multiple Pathways**: Sequential→SRS→Strengthening→Sequential flows
- **Performance Analytics**: Rich data on why items graduate or need more work
- **User Control**: Accept/reject system recommendations with full transparency

### Enhanced SRS Algorithm
- **Multiple Strategies**: Conservative, standard, aggressive SRS approaches
- **Pattern Integration**: SRS intervals work with other patterns seamlessly  
- **Performance Learning**: Algorithm tunes itself based on your responses
- **Graduation Intelligence**: Smart pathways out of SRS back to normal patterns
