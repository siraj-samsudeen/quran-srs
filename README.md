# Quran SRS

## Intro

### One-line summary
An attempt to use the concept of Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to make the memorization and revision of Quran easier. 

### How will it benefit me?
1. Rather than doing a revision of a fixed number of pages (say 20, 40, or 60 pages) per day, you can bring down the number of pages
2. You can focus more time on the difficult parts and less time on the easy parts - thus helping you to improve your memorization
3. Systematic revision forces you to stay on track and not lose the memorized pages completely (assuming you do at least a few pages suggested by the algorithm)

## Historical Context

**Repository Evolution**: Django → FastHTML → Phoenix

- **Django Era (2020-2022)**: Initial spaced repetition system - only pure SRS mode was supported where pages will come only in random order, dictated purely by the SRS algorithm. 
- **FastHTML Version (March - July 2025)**: Complete rewrite to incorporate sequential revision mode in addition to a number of different SRS modes along with multi-hafiz support. 
- **Phoenix Migration (August 2025)**: Migration to Phoenix LiveViews for productive development and responsive user interactions.
